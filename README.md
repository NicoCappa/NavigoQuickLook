# NavigoQuickLook

The current version on this repository contains non-funcitonal parts, which are added to prepare the app for an update over spring break (Because I plan to keep updating this until it's a good enough product to sell to a large trading room I've been talking with.) 

What is supposed to be running, are the news, the 4 initialization equities (WYNN, NVDA, GOOG, and MSFT), and the chart lookup.
